# STREAMLIT CLOUD DEPLOYMENT OF A MACHINE LEARNING MULTI-DISEASE PREDICTOR IN PYTHON

This Python-based project is a web-based application built using Streamlit and machine learning models. It provides predictions for three different diseases: diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease. Users can select the disease they want to predict, enter relevant health information as input, and then click a button to receive a prediction result. For diabetes prediction, it considers features such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, and many other factors. Heart disease prediction takes into account factors like age, sex, chest pain type, and many other relevant health indicators. In the case of Parkinson's disease, various voice-related features and other relevant health data are used for predictions. The application loads pre-trained machine learning models using the pickle library. Deployed on Streamlit Cloud, it offers a user-friendly interface for making predictions, making it a valuable tool for health riskÂ assessment.
